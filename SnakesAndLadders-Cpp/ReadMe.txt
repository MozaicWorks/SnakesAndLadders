Compile the code using 'make' on MacOS or Linux. On Windows, either use cygwin or create a Visual Studio project to import the files. Only three source files are required: Game.cpp, Game.h and GameRunner.cpp.

After compiling with 'make', the executable is created in bin/SnakesAndLadders. Run it and enjoy!
